"""Render an edit plan (plan.json) into a finished 30fps CFR video (1920x1080
by default; vertical and square formats too).

Everything here is free to use in monetized YouTube videos: ffmpeg
(LGPL/GPL), OpenCV (Apache 2.0) and the YuNet face model (MIT) put no
conditions on the videos made with them, and nothing calls a paid service.

Every time in the plan is a per-clip source time (0 at that file's start),
never a project-timeline time -- see transcribe.py. The plan is a list of
segments, played in order:

    {"clip": "cam", "start": 4.1, "end": 10.9}
        A piece of one clip, its own audio. Optional "speed" (default 1,
        slow-mo below 1, fast-forward above -- audio tempo is chained across
        multiple atempo filters since ffmpeg rejects a single atempo outside
        0.5-2.0). Optional "zoom": {"factor": 1.3, "cx": 0.5, "cy": 0.4,
        "ease_in": 0.3, "ease_out": 0.3} for a punch-in -- eases from 1x to
        "factor" over ease_in seconds of the segment's own (post-speed)
        output duration, holds, eases back out over the last ease_out
        seconds. cx/cy (0-1, default centered) is the zoom target point.
    {"photo": "IMG_0887.HEIC", "duration": 1.5}
        A still with a slow push-in, silent.
    {"block": "phone", "video": [{"clip": "rec", "start": .., "end": .., "speed": ..}, ...],
     "audio": [{"clip": "old", "start": .., "end": .., "at": 0.0} | {"file": "vo.wav", "at": 0.0}]}
        Several video pieces played back to back, with separately placed
        audio on top (voiceover over a silent screen recording). "at" is the
        offset inside the block. The block's own clip audio is dropped.

Any segment can also take:
    "pip": {"clip": "rec", "start": 140, "speed": 1, "position": "right", "height": 0.75}
        Another clip inset over this one, running from its own source "start"
        for as long as the segment lasts (holds its last frame if it runs out).
        Silent. position: left/right/top-left/top-right/bottom-left/bottom-right.
        height: fraction of the frame (default 0.75 vertical, 0.32 otherwise).
    "fade_in" / "fade_out": seconds, picture from/to black and audio with it.
    "volume_db": gain on the segment's audio.
    "overlays": [{"graphic": "warning1.mov", "at": 37.2}]
        Transparent graphics from graphics.py (<work_dir>/graphics/), or
        any PNG with "duration". Plays once, from "at".
    "sfx": [{"file": "whoosh.wav", "at": 37.0, "volume_db": -6}]
        Sound effects from the shared pool (_editor/assets/sfx/, falling
        back to the work dir), mixed on top of the segment's audio.
    "broll": [{"photo": "receipts.jpg", "at": 59.0, "duration": 4},
              {"clip": "rec", "start": 196, "at": 44.0, "duration": 5}]
        Full-frame cutaways: the picture switches to a photo (slow push-in)
        or another clip (from its own source "start", in that clip's
        layout) while this segment's audio keeps playing.
    "music": false
        Keep the background music silent during this segment (it ramps out
        and back in around it) -- e.g. clips that already have music baked in.

  Picture:
    "flip": "horizontal" | "vertical" | "both"
    "rotate": 90 | 180 | 270 (turns the source, e.g. sideways phone footage)
              or any other angle (tilts the frame, zoomed so no corners show)
    "stabilize": true | {"shakiness": 5, "smoothing": 15}   (clip segments)
        Two-pass vid.stab; the motion analysis is cached in <work_dir>/stab.
    "reverse": true      (clip segments, up to 30s; audio plays backwards too)
    "reframe": "auto" | 0-1   (clip segments with the default "fill" layout)
        Crop to fill the frame following the largest face (OpenCV YuNet,
        cached in <work_dir>/reframe.json), or at a fixed horizontal
        position. Mostly for landscape footage in a vertical Short.
    "transform": {"scale": 0.75, "x": 0.5, "y": 0.5, "rotate": -4,
                  "border": {"width": 12, "color": "white"},
                  "shadow": true | {"blur": 18, "opacity": 0.55, "offset": 16},
                  "background": "blur" | "black" | "#1d3557",
                  "enter": "slide_left|slide_right|slide_up|slide_down|pop|fade",
                  "exit": same names, "anim": 0.4}
        Shrink the picture into a card over a background, with border,
        drop shadow, tilt and an animated entrance/exit.
    "motion" (photos): "push_in" (default) | "pull_out" | "pan_left" |
        "pan_right" | "pan_up" | "pan_down" | "none"
  Look (applied to the footage, B-roll and PiP -- never to graphics):
    "enhance": true        auto light/colour fix (contrast, white balance, vibrance, light sharpen)
    "color": {"brightness": 0.03, "contrast": 1.1, "saturation": 1.2, "gamma": 1.0,
              "vibrance": 0.2, "temperature": 5500, "shadows": 0.5, "highlights": -0.3,
              "lut": "film.cube"}     (LUT files go in <work_dir>/luts)
    "sharpen": 0.5-1.5
    "filters": ["bw", "sepia", "vintage", "vignette", "blur", "grain", "invert",
                "warm", "cool", "vivid", "cinematic", "letterbox", "glow"]
  Joins:
    "transition": {"type": "fade", "duration": 0.5}
        Into this segment from the previous one (they overlap by the
        duration). Types: fade, dissolve, fadeblack, fadewhite, wipeleft/
        right/up/down, slideleft/right/up/down, smoothleft/right, circleopen/
        close, radial, zoomin, pixelize, hblur, distance. Any transition makes
        the join a re-encode instead of a stream copy.
    For overlays, sfx and broll, "at" on a clip segment is that clip's SOURCE time
    (so re-trimming the segment doesn't move the graphic off its moment);
    on a photo or block it's seconds into the segment. Anything that would
    start outside the segment is skipped with a warning.

Plan-level options:
    "format": "landscape" (1920x1080, default) | "vertical" (1080x1920, Shorts) | "square" (1080x1080)
    "defaults": {"enhance": true, ...}
        Settings applied to every segment unless the segment sets its own.
    "destination": "youtube" | "amazon"   -- required if "music" is set.
    "music": {"files": ["a.mp3", "b.mp3"], "level_lufs": -30, "crossfade": 2}
        A playlist under the video, crossfaded track to track and repeated
        if it runs short, ducked whenever someone talks. It starts at the
        first segment that allows music. Each track is gain-matched to
        level_lufs using its loudness from catalog_music.py's catalog
        (tracks not in the catalog fall back to "volume_db", default -20).
        Files are relative to music_dir in config.json. {"file": "x.mp3"}
        still works for a single track. Refused for Amazon videos: Liz's
        rule is music on YouTube videos only.
    "voice_level_lufs": -20
        Gain every segment's own audio (and block voiceover pieces) so they
        all sit at the same loudness before mixing. Each piece of 3s or more
        is measured on its own; shorter ones use their whole file's level.
        Measurements are cached in <work_dir>/loudness.json. Without it,
        sources recorded at different distances play several dB apart and
        music swamps the quiet ones.
    "voice_cleanup": true
        Rumble cut, noise reduction, a little presence and gentle
        compression on every clip's own audio and clip voiceover pieces
        (not music or sfx), and on voiceover files in blocks. A clip can opt
        out with "voice_cleanup": false.
    "captions": true, "transcripts": ["transcript.json", "../other/transcript.json"]
        Burn in captions from the word timings. Words are matched to plan
        clips by file stem (transcribe.py's default clip id), so audio from
        any clip (or a transcribed voiceover file) gets captioned wherever
        the plan uses it.

A clip can set "restore": true when its file was heavily compressed (e.g.
sent through WhatsApp): deblock + denoise at source size, lanczos upscale,
light sharpen. It can't bring back lost detail -- originals are always better.

"clips" maps short ids to files under footage_root. Each clip's "layout" is
"fill" (crop to 16:9, default) or "vertical" (phone screen centred over a
blurred copy of itself). "audio_track" picks the audio stream (default 0;
iPhone .MOVs also carry an unusable 4ch apac track as 0:a:1).

Segments render to <work_dir>/render/NNN.mp4 in one uniform format, then get
concatenated, music-mixed, captioned and loudness-normalised to -14 LUFS.

Usage:
    python tools/render.py --name video1
    python tools/render.py --name video1 --only 3      # re-render one segment, then re-join
    python tools/render.py --name video1 --preview     # fast 540p review copy -> <name>_preview.mp4
